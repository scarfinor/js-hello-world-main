This repository is for the "Your First Program" example in the _Introduction to Web Development_ textbook's _How Programs Work_ chapter.  

## Your First Program: `hello-world`

1. Use your terminal to locate where you want to save this repository.
1. Fork and clone this repository at the location you have selected.
1. Open the project in your IDE.  
1. Explore the code provided.  Read any commented instructions.
1. Open a terminal and `cd` into your project directory.  Remember to use `ls` to verify your location.  You are in the project directory when you see `hello.js` after running the `ls` command.
1. Once inside your project, type the command: `npm install`.  This will create a few new files and directories that contain dependencies your project may need. You will learn about this step more in the next lesson.
1. Once that is installed, type the following into the same terminal: `node hello`.  You should see the message you coded inside `hello.js` appear in your terminal.

See the textbook for more instructions.


_Troubleshooting:_ If you don't see any output, check where you are in the terminal.  Make sure you can see the `hello.js` file when you run the `ls` command.
